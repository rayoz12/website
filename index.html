<h2>My Projects:</h2>
<h3>Snowball Warfare</h3>
<p>A game I made for my major project in Year 12 Software Design and Development. It was my first foray into programming and it was really fun to make, learning all the in and outs of the logic you had to use to implement everything. It is implemented completely in JavaScript on the client side, with canvas the HTML5 graphics API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway enough talking here's the live view: <a href="Projects/SnowBallWarfare/">Snowball warfare</a> </p>
<h3>Java Learner</h3>
<p>During my time at university I undertook an extra-curricular activity in my first year called software development studio. This involved me being placed in a team and developing a project for a client. Our client was a teacher who wanted to use the accessibility of the Internet to his advantage to allow students from any platform connect and test their Java skills.

<h3>JavaLearner (zip not available)</h3>
<p>For a subject at UTS I worked with a team to make a web site that students could use to learn Java. It also acted as testing platform to better engage the students and better their skill. Our team decide to implement it in a flexible way to enable the service to work with any programming language. My role in the team was mostly to program the JavaScript client side to interact the user.</p>

<h3>Music Player</h3>
<p>A small music player with hotkey support.</p>
<p>This will be completely rewritten in the future.</p>

<h3>Playlist Extractor</h3>
<p>This extracts the music files saved in playlists. Was also a learning experience for me making my first C# program. This currently works on .wpl (used by windows media player) and .m3u (with relative paths) playlists.</p>

<h3>AutoHotKey music hotkey script</h3>
<p>This for people with keyboards that don't have media keys. It emulates those media keys via AHK. There is also a Media Player Classic Home Cinema version that sends directly to MPCHC, which means it's more reliable.</p>
<p>Special thanks for the library functions from specter333: <a href="https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/73687-media-player-classic-home-cinema-function-libraries/">https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/73687-media-player-classic-home-cinema-function-libraries/</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HSC Exam Downloader</h3>
<p>While I can't vouch if it still works now as it was made in 2014, it has some interesting source and a GUI for a powershell script. As far as I remember most of it was implemented, but the board of studies changed URL formats throughout the years and that might break this.</p>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I'm a student currently studying towards a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (ICT Engineering, Software sub-major) at the University of Technology, Sydney. I'm always looking forward to new challenges and learning experience as a student so that I better cope in the real world and to better myself.</p>

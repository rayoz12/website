			<h2>My Past</h2>
			<p>
				As a child, I was always fascinated with technology and it worked, particularly how computers worked to
				display graphics, process data and work so efficiently. Playing video games as a child I was always
				amazed at how a computer could emulate seemingly complex tasks like open worlds and physics so easily.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I grew up with technology, I became handier with it and spurred on by its interest I wanted to
				understand how they worked. In high school, I was able to land myself a job for IT support in a small
				business.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past, I have done a variety of computing subjects. High school is where I started programming in
				the subject Software Design and Development (SDD) at the same time I also took Information Processes and
				Technology (IPT). In high school, I had a rough idea that I wanted to work in IT but I didn't know
				where. SDD is where I started to become interested in programming, we learned HTML, CSS, advanced
				JavaScript and many programming concepts.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a third year at UTS, I've studied many interesting subject, from the high level of web development to
				the low level of C and assembly, it has been great fun and provided so many chances to see what I like.
			</p>
			<h3>Some of the subjects that I recommend</h3>

			<h2>My Future</h2>
			<p>
				With my skills I hope to find a good place in the software development market, while my interest in web
				development is waning, I hope that the engineering aspect my degree will lead me to new paths and
				interests.
			</p>

			<p>
				As mentioned in my past page one of the pieces of software I was always amazed at was games and their
				complexity and since then one of my personal goals has been to become a game developer for a major
				company. I hope the skills I learn at UTS and outside will continue to lead me to there. Another "dream"
				job would be to have a job that is able to let me travel the world. Although unlikely in my field I have
				still met many people who through business and company events travel the world.

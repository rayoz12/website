This determines 1. how soon each activity can start, 2. how soon each activity can finish,and 3. how soon the entire project can be completed.","difficulty":"Level: Difficult"},{"question":"87.In the network computation process what is a backward pass and what four things does it determine?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"Starting with the last activity, each path is traced backward through the network, subtracting times until thebeginning of the project. This determines 1. how late each activity can start, 2. how late each activitycan finish, 3. the critical path, and 4. how long can each activity be delayed without changing the completiondate.","difficulty":"Level: Difficult"},{"question":"88.What is total slack and how do you determine it?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"Slack is the amount of time specific activities can be delayed without causing the project to miss its completiondate. It is calculated by subtracting the Early Start date from the Late Start date (SL = LS-ES) or subtractingthe Early Finish date from the Late Finish date (SL = LF-EF).","difficulty":"Level: Medium"},{"question":"89.What is a Gantt chart and what advantages does it have over project networks?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"Gantt charts are bar charts where activities are displayed as bars on a horizontal time-scale. They are easy-to-readand provide a clear overview of the project schedule and progress against that schedule.","difficulty":"Level: Medium"},{"question":"90.What is the laddering approach to project networks and why would you use this approach?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"In laddering, lengthy activities are segmented into small pieces so that successor activities can begin priorto the completion of the initial activity. This effectively reduces the overall project time. The text useda laying pipeline example to illustrate.","difficulty":"Level: Medium"},{"question":"91.What is a lag and why would you need to use one?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"A lag is the minimum amount of time a dependent activity must be delayed to begin or end. They occur during ladderingand avoid delays and they are also used to constraint the start and finish of an activity.","difficulty":"Level: Medium"},{"question":"92.What is a hammock activity and give an example?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"A hammock activity identifies the use of a resource over a segment of the project. Thus its duration is determinedby the duration of other activities. The example used in the text was for a color copier during specificphases of a project.","difficulty":"Level: Medium"},{"question":"93.What is the Concurrent Engineering Approach and why should project managers be aware of it?","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"The chainlike sequence of finish-to-start relationships is replaced by a series of start-to-start lag relationshipsas soon as meaningful work can be initiated for the next phase. The resulting overlap of tasks slightly increasesrisk but results in a much shorter schedule.","difficulty":"Level: Difficult"},{"question":"94.Identify and briefly describe the four types of lags giving an example for each type.","type":"shortAnswer","answer":"","help":"1.
